## Current: [March 28th](html/20200328-covid-model.html)

In today's update, error bounds for most countries have narrowed. The one week corridor for fatal outcomes in the US, Italy and Spain looks grim.


## Context

The novel coronavirus is bringing societies worldwide to a halt and causing widespread health impacts and fatal outcomes. Still, there appears to be a paucity of information how the crisis is likely to unfold in the near future. Most news outlets only show aggreate numbers, color-coded world maps, or descriptive statistics of the current situation. 

This repository holds a daily series, in which I am taking a closer look at numbers and trends, and making some tentative projections. All data are taken from the [Johns Hopkins Covid-19 dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) on GitHub. Each day, Johns Hopkins update the dataset with figures for the previous day; I salute their diligent work. Recently, every second day or so, they unfortunately also change some aspect of the format: dropping indicators, changing entity names etc. 

All projections are based on curve fitting on a per-country level. Thus, they extrapolate current trends. By nature, they can neither reflect the impact of recently enacted measures, which are expected to reduce infection rates, nor can they reflect new adverse developments. So please take everything with a grain of salt.

Stay safe, look after your loved ones, and stay healthy.
